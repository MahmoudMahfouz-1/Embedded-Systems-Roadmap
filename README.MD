# A Road Map For Embedded Systems

>This roadmap was created for the Embedded Systems committee in ***IEEE Mansoura Computer Society Chapter*** by Mahmoud Essam Mahfouz, head of the committee. I hope you get the most benefit from it.


## Objectives:

>The main goal for this road map is to prepare committee members to be able to work as Embedded Software Engineer either in a company or as a freelancer

## Levels:


- Beginner : Introduction to Embedded Systems & C Language
- Intermediate: Data Structure & Embedded C
- Advanced: Interfacing
